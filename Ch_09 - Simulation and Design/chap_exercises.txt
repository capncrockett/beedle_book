3: Spiral development would make sense if I wasn't totally sure what the
program was going to do in the end. I would start at what I can do and
work my way out. Let's start with just rolling a die. Then rolling two.
Can I make a program that rolls multiple dice with multiple faces? Can
I make it so a user can choose which ones to roll, and how many? Can I
apply it to, or insert it into, a larger game like DnD?

Solution: The issue here is mainly comfort/risk. When there is
uncertainty whether the problem can even be solved, starting with an
experimental prototype is probably a good idea.
